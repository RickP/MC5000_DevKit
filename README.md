# MC5000_DevKit

A development board that brings the [Shenzhen IO game](https://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/) to real hardware.

This documentation is intended for people who want to build/extend/bugfix the hardware. If you have a board and just want to play with it you'll find the user documentation [here](https://rickp.github.io/MC5000_DevKit/).

## Overview

The project consists of three parts. The firmware for the PFS173 microcontroller used in this project, a circuit board that connects to a computer via USB and a cross-platform desktop application that is used to programm the board.

The main use of this is to teach beginners the basics of programming and electronics by solving problems with increasing difficulty. Users have to make electric connection on the circuit board with jumper cable and programm the two microcontrollers with a simplified assembler language to solve the tasks.
